                I currently supervise 6 PhD students, 4 research fellows, 2 research associates, and 1 research 
                assistant. Since 2007, I have supervised 17 PhD students, two of whom received the Best 
                Graduate Researcher Award in our department. My PhD and postdoctoral alumni have gone on 
                to hold prestigious academic and industry positions, including:

            <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mb-2">
                Since joining NUS in 2007, I have proposed nine new modules (four core undergraduate and 
                five graduate electives) and taught fourteen different modules across undergraduate and 
                graduate levels. These courses focus on quantitative methods and are often delivered to large 
                classes, with a median enrollment of 79 and a maximum of 461 students.
